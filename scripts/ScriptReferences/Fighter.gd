## This script holds the main components of a Fighter.[br]
## A Fighter has several variables and methods which are accessed and called by the game.[br]
## input_step() is called with the latest buffer of inputs.[br]
## damage_step() is called per each overlapping hitbox after handling inputs,
## with the details of the attack.[br]
## For safety, nothing should modify the fighter's state in _process, _physics_process,
## or _ready. _process and _physics_process are purely for real-time effects, and _ready for initialization.
